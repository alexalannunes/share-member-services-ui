## Shared member services app (Web UI)
![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/alexalannunes/share-member-services-ui/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg)

Do you use streaming :sound: or storage :open_file_folder: services and share with someone? With this app you control who are the people who are sharing the same services as you and how much of each one you should charge :sunglasses: (just an assumption)
